### PR/Commit Guidelines

There are certain conventions we follow in the project, we recommend that you become familiar with these so that the development process is uniform for everyone.

Please help us follow best practices to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor.

 * **Single commit per pull request**. (Please squash all your commits as multiple commits make it harder for reviewers to review, and thereby increase the time it will take to merge your PR.)
 * **For writing commit messages** please read FOSSASIA's **[COMMITSTYLE](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app/blob/development/docs/commitStyle.md)** carefully. Kindly adhere to the guidelines.
 * **If the PR is related to any front end change**, please either attach relevant screenshots or describe point by point each of your changes in the pull request description.
